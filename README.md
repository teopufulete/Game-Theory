# Game-Theory 
Calculating the Nash equilibrium for different types of games.

#### Includes: 
- Rock, paper, scissors
- Prisoners Dilemma
- Battle of the sexes

## Rules:
 #### Prisoners Dilemma:
 - Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of     communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are: 
      * If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
      * If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison
      * If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free
      * If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

#### Bach or Stravinsky:
- There are two players: A and B
- They wish to go out together to a musical concert, but A prefers Bach and B prefers Stravinsky.
- A and B want to coordinate their behaviour, but they have conflicting interests.
